    <h1>the <span style="font-family: 'cursive'">OASIS</span> welcomes you.</h1>
    <p>
      Come relax at the Extinct Oasis. Here at the Oasis we have misters running
      every afternoon to beat that hot desert heat. We have a massive cuddle
      puddle, relaxing lounge, and a dance floor with all the grooves. The bar
      is open if the misters are misting. We offer some fancy smancy cocktails,
      a N/A drink of sorts, and some warm water.

      Speaking of hot, do you like hot food? Because we serve up the best hot
      fried chicken you've ever tasted. Join us for the DEADBIRD COOKOUT here we
      got fresh hot fried chicken & waffles being served for sunset. Find the
      dates in the What, When, and Where Book! If you are lucky you can be on
      the lookout for our mobile bar. We got the POTATO EXPERIENCE rolling
      around the deep playa late at night serving up the tastiest baked
      potatoes! And of course it comes with all of the fixings. One early
      morning for sunrise or late for sunset you can also find the bar serving
      up frozen MIMOSA BALLS. yes SUNRISE or SUNSET SQUEEZE is sure to quench
      your thirst. We freeze OJ and serve it with champagne bringing you the
      refreshment you desire.
